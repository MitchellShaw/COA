# COA

There is a need in my manufacturing plant to keep track of COA's(Windows Serial numbers) going out the door. We have a problem of giving customers who don't require a COA
a COA, and we're sending units that suppose to have COA's  without them. I was tasked with devolping a program to handle this and I decided a 
dashboard is a great way to keep up with the orders on the floor.
